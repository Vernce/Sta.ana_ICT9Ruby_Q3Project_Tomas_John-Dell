     <section id="biography" class="mt-4">

     <p> Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, born 7 October 1952 is a Russian politician and former intelligence officer who is the current President of Russia. Putin has held continuous positions as prime minister from 1999 to 2008, and as president from 2012. In April 2021, after a referendum, he signed into law constitutional amendments that included one allowing him to run for reelection twice more, potentially extending his presidency to 2036.</p>

     <p> Putin worked as a KGB foreign intelligence officer for 16 years, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel before resigning in 1991 to begin a political career in Saint Petersburg. In 1996, he moved to Moscow to join the administration of President Boris Yeltsin. He briefly served as the director of the Federal Security Service (FSB) and then as secretary of the Security Council of Russia before being appointed prime minister in August 1999. Following Yeltsin's resignation, Putin became acting president and, in less than four months, was elected to his first term as president.</p>

     <p> His rule over Russia has been marked by corruption and widespread human rights violations, including the imprisonment and suppression of political opponents, intimidation and censorship of independent media in Russia, and a lack of free and fair elections.</p>
